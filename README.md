This is a tool I made to assist in the modding process for HDR. It *should* be safe, in that it will only work in a yuzu folder, and makes backups of all mods prior to the deletion of them.


# How to set up?
Click on the releases page to the right, and download the latest release. Unzip the folder and run the 'YuzuHDRHelper.exe'. All downloads/backups from this tool will appear in the same folder as the executable.

# 'I want the tool to do (insert idea)'
I would love to add more features to this program! If you have any ideas, send me a DM on discord (username: HighlyHylian). While I can't give you a time frame, I will definitely consider your idea!
